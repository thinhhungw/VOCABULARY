## 🔗 Install C++: https://www.msys2.org/
- You **must** run it on CMD (Command Prompt).  

## 🛠️ HOW TO USE  
- The program prints a word, and you enter its meaning.  
- The words are taken from the **tuvung.csv** file.  
- You can modify the **tuvung.csv** file to use your own words.  
- If your answer is **correct**, the program prints **YES** and updates your **COMBO** (consecutive correct answers).  
- If your answer is **wrong**, the program prints **NO**.  
- If you **don't know** the answer, type **"?"** to reveal it and move to the next word.  
- To **exit** the program, type **"done"**.   

## ⚠️ TROUBLESHOOTING  
- If the code doesn't run, it's likely because the file paths are incorrect.  
- Open the code and update the path to **tuvung.csv** to match your system.
