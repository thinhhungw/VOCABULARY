## üìö HELP STUDY NEW LANGUAGE

## üîó Install C++: https://www.msys2.org/
- You **must** run it on CMD (Command Prompt).

## üõ†Ô∏è HOW TO USE (`vocabulary.cpp`)
- The program prints a word, and you enter its meaning.
- The words are taken from the **vocabulary.csv** file.
- If your answer is **correct**, the program prints **YES** and updates your **COMBO** (consecutive correct answers).
- If your answer is **wrong**, the program prints **NO**.
- If you **don't know** the answer, type **"?"** to reveal it and move to the next word.
- To **remove** the current word from the list, type **"remove"**.
- To **exit** the program, type **"done"**.

## ‚ú® ADDING NEW WORDS (`addvocabulary.cpp`)
- Run the `addvocabulary.cpp` program separately.
- Follow the prompts to enter the new word and its meaning.
- Your new vocabulary will be saved to the **vocabulary.csv** file for use with the main study program.
- Type **"done"** for the word when you are finished adding.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è TROUBLESHOOTING
- If the code doesn't run, it's likely because the file paths are incorrect.
- Open the code (`vocabulary.cpp` and `addvocabulary.cpp`) and update the path to **vocabulary.csv** to match your system.
